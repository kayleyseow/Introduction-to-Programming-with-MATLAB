%Answers to caesar from Coursera
function txt = caesarModFunction(txt,key)
    txt = double(txt) + key;
    first = double(' ');
    last = double('~');
    % use mod to shift the characters - notice the + 1
    % this is a common error and results in shifts 
    % being off by 1
    txt = char(mod(txt - first,last - first + 1) + first);
end
